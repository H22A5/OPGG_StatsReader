# OPGG_StatsReader
Simple app for data collection from op.gg website

To run the application you will need few things:
-jsoup library
-silenium library
-javafx library
-Chrome browser
-chromedriver.exe corresponding to the version of your Chrome browser(I uploaded one with the whole project - latest version 84)
-in function updateData() you should check if the path to chromedriver.exe(setProperty function second argument) is correct for yours

If you have any doubts, feel free to ask. :)
